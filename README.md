The primary goal of the "Garage Master" project is to 
create an online platform that specializes in selling parts and items for car 
and bike modifications. This platform will allow users to browse, 
customize, and purchase modification parts with ease, and see a preview 
of what their vehicles will look like after the modifications. The project 
aims to provide a seamless and engaging user experience from browsing 
to checkout, incorporating various design patterns to ensure efficiency and 
scalability.
